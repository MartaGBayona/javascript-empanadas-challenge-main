## Development progress :open_book:


### The statement of the problem":

- Develop the problem on paper.

### JavaScript Code Implementation:

- Declare variables
- Solve error control with an if/else conditional.
- Begin to solve the cases individually, both with if/else and with switch case, seeking the most optimal option.
- Managed to control the errors and got correct results for 2 out of 5 cases.

### Reassessment of the case:

- We aim to calculate the average of the products and apply decimal correction in cases where the average is not an integer.
- Implement a for loop that increments by 0.1 in each iteration until the next integer.
- Corrected the code and removed unnecessary information.
